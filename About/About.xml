Update of Jaxxas mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=722090464

- Removed the use of hoppers, will now use any adjacent storage
- No longer spawned in the world, deep mineral patches or as material in items
- Reinforced wood is not a weapon as it would be too heavy
- Fixed all buildtimes and mass values to be 10x the normal amount
- Darkened the graphics for all reinforced resources to make them easier to separate from the basic materials

Version: 0.17.0
	
Adds a Reinforced version of some Stuff. This allows for stronger constructions. Reinforced stuff has 10x the hitpoints but at 10x build time. Reinforced Stuff is made from 10 Normal Stuff in a Molecular Reinforcement Compressor. Currently Reinforced Stuff can be made from Steel, Plasteel, Wood, Stone, Silver, Gold, Uranium and Jade.
